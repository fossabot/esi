Welcome to esi's documentation!
===============================

Esi is a http client for interacting with ESI (EVE Swagger Interface) from which we get our namesake.

Esi is developed in PHP and is made possible by `httplug <http://httplug.io/>`_.

.. note::

    HTTPlug allows you to write reusable libraries and applications that need
    an HTTP client without binding to a specific implementation.
    When all packages used in an application only specify HTTPlug
    the application developers can choose the client that best fits their project
    and use the same client with all packages.

    It might be beneficial to understand what httplug is and how to use it before deciding to use this library.
    We'll cover that in the usage section.
