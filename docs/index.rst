Welcome to esi's documentation!
===============================

The esi client is a simple php http client made possible by `httplug <http://httplug.io/>`_.

.. note::

    HTTPlug allows you to write reusable libraries and applications that need
    an HTTP client without binding to a specific implementation.
    When all packages used in an application only specify HTTPlug
    the application developers can choose the client that best fits their project
    and use the same client with all packages.

As we can see there are some huge advantages to developing with httplug.

To see how you can begin using esi please see :doc:`/esi/introduction`.
