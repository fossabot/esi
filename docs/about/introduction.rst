Motivation
----------

Esi was a major improvement over the previous XML and CREST API's offered by EVE Online and marked a new era in
third party application development for EVE Online. On May 8th 2018, CCP are shutting down both XML and CREST in favour
of ESI.

As such new and old application need a simple to use and fully featured API client. Esi hopes to be that client.
